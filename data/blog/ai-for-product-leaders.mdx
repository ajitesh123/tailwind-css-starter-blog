This blog gives an overview of the new initiative I'm part of: AI for Product Leaders. We aim to equip product leaders with the skills and insights needed to build successful AI applications. And build a community of product leaders who can learn, discuss, and grow together.

## Why am I doing this course?

In this course, you will learn to build AI applications tailored for Product Leaders. Leveraging my experience as the CEO of Archie AI and former PM of Gemini for Google Cloud, I will guide you through the critical know-hows required to support and lead AI application development effectively.

At Google, I launched the industry's first GenAI experience for cloud infrastructure management. At Archie AI, I developed the first version of our application and managed all aspects of applied Large Language Model (LLM) experiences, including coding. This course distills my learnings from both these diverse environments to equip you with the skills and insights needed to build successful AI applications.

I'm hosting this course with [Jinal Dalal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jinal-dalal/), Director Engineering at Google. He has been leading engineering teams at Google for over 10 years and has deep experience in building AI applications.

### Key Highlights:

- Practical Industry Experience: Insights from both a startup and a big tech environment.
- Concise Learning: Under 60 minutes to gain deep, actionable knowledge.
- Comprehensive Resources: Video lessons, slides, a polished handbook, and an open-source code repository.

## Who Is This Course For?

4. Hands-on AI Application Development
5. Defining Success and Production Readiness
6. Conclusion

## 1. AI Opportunity Landscape

AI represents a massive opportunity, with significant investments fueling its growth:

- VC Investment: $100B
- GPU Investment: $600B
- Revenue Projections: AI expected to create 200+ $1B revenue firms, compared to 20 from the cloud era.

### Top AI Firms:

- GitHub Copilot ($100M ARR)
- Glean ($40M ARR)
- MidJourney ($200M ARR)

### Key Differences in AI Product Development:

While the basics remain the same—defining problem statements clearly, conducting customer research, etc.—the experience, interface, and application building for AI are much different from what we're used to.

- Data-Centric Approach: Emphasis on data quality and relevance.
- Probabilistic Output: AI models provide probabilistic, not deterministic, outputs.
- Model Selection and Fine-Tuning: Choosing and customizing models is crucial.
- Explainability and Interpretability: Understanding AI decisions builds trust.
- Prompt Engineering: Crafting effective prompts impacts performance.
- User Expectation Management: High expectations require careful management.

This presents a massive opportunity for PMs to play a more critical role in product development like never before. It's one of those times when PMs should have opinions on how code is written—including prompting, chaining, and model selection.

## 2. Role in Building AI Applications

### Opportunity Analysis

Not every AI opportunity makes sense for your business. You need to:

- Understand the Technology: Know what AI can and cannot do.
- Match Use Cases: Identify where AI adds real value.
- Consider Unit Economics: LLM experiences have inherent costs per use.

### Filters for AI Opportunity (Example from Insights for Gemini Project):

- Accuracy Standards Aren't High:
  - For critical tasks (e.g., life and death), ensure a human-in-the-loop.
  - For less critical tasks, AI can automate or assist.
- Ease of Data Integration:
  - Bringing data to AI should be straightforward.

### Experience Design:

Early LLM applications focused on chat tools, but limitations include:

- Feeling gimmicky or limited in scope.
- User fatigue with chat-based interactions.
- Challenges handling complex, multi-step tasks.

### Notable AI UI Experiences:

- Cursor CMD+K and CMD+L: Seamless AI integration into the editor.
- Streaming Text with Auto-Scroll: Enhances user engagement.
- Google NotebookML: Mimics podcast experiences for topic discovery.
- Context Management Tools: Claude Artifacts, OpenAI Canvas.

### Forms of AI-Based Application Experiences

- Embedded LLM Experience: Integrate AI into existing products (e.g., Google Search AI overview).
- AI Assistant (Augmentation): Focus on complex, meaningful tasks (e.g., AI-powered music composition).
- AI Automation: Automate small, bounded, repetitive tasks (e.g., email categorization).

## 3. Technical Foundations

### Basics of LLMs:

- How They Work: Understanding the mechanics behind large language models.
- Strengths: What tasks LLMs excel at.
- Popular Providers: Overview of leading LLM providers.

### Prompt Engineering Techniques:

- Few-Shot Prompting: Providing examples to guide LLM responses.
- Chain of Thought Prompting: Encouraging step-by-step reasoning.
- Role-Based Prompting: Directing the LLM to act in a specific role.
- Constrained Prompting: Structuring outputs for specific formats (e.g., JSON, XML).

### Advanced Concepts:

- Agentic Workflow: Enabling AI agents to perform a series of actions.
- Vector Databases: Utilizing specialized databases for high-dimensional data (e.g., Pinecone, Qdrant).
- Key Terms: Embedding models, similarity search, and more.

## 4. Hands-on AI Application Development

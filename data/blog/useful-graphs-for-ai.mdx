This blog is a living document capturing AI trends in graphs. I plan to do this for myself, but I thought it might be useful for others.

A related goal of this blog is to play with nice visulaiztions in react :) And test whether data can be presented in a way that is more engaging than a table.

## Cloud and AI

It was quite interesting to witness the AI trend during my time at Google Cloud. After the pandemic, we saw a slowdown in cloud spending as companies optimized costs. You could hear the same in Amazon and Microsoft earnings calls about AWS and Azure.

Then came the recent surge, driven by AI. Initially, it was hard to tell whether it was a short spike because of a handful of players over-investing in AI. But the growth was visible across the stack—even in data movement into and within Google Cloud, which was the primary metric for the product I worked on.

Now it's clearer than ever—after mobile and cloud, AI is shaping up to be the next big platform shift!

This chart from Battery Ventures nicely puts it together.

This blog is a living document capturing AI trends in graphs. I plan to do this for myself, but I thought it might be useful for others.

A related goal of this blog is to play with nice visulaiztions in react :) And test whether data can be presented in a way that is more engaging than a table.

## Cloud and AI

It was quite interesting to witness the AI trend during my time at Google Cloud. After the pandemic, we saw a slowdown in cloud spending as companies optimized costs. You could hear the same in Amazon and Microsoft earnings calls about AWS and Azure.

Then came the recent surge, driven by AI. Initially, it was hard to tell whether it was a short spike because of a handful of players over-investing in AI. But the growth was visible across the stack—even in data movement into and within Google Cloud, which was the primary metric for the product I worked on.

Now it's clearer than ever—after mobile and cloud, AI is shaping up to be the next big platform shift!

This chart from Battery Ventures nicely puts it together.

## AI Wave in $$

There has been strong investment in AI startups.

But it's hard to say it's a bubble:

- We already have few firms `>$100M ARR`
- The market is big; covered in next graph
- Even for OpenAI, if we ignore profitability, the usage, revenue and valuation numbers in recent fund raise match that of Google at IPO

## AI Market Size

Cloud was changing how software is written and deployed - microservices, serverless, containerized applications etc. Primary impact was in enterprise space.

Cloud-based software aggresively capture big portion of software market. This now is $400B market

AI is now automating labor - writing code, drafting legal documents, handling customer support, etc. That is an order of magnitude larger market.

Here are numbers from Sequoia Capital's presentation.

## LLM Market Share

The LLM market has seen significant shifts between 2023 and 2024. While OpenAI remains the market leader, their share has decreased from 50% to 34%. This decline has been primarily absorbed by Anthropic and Google, who have gained 12% and 5% market share respectively.

This redistribution suggests a maturing market where competition is intensifying. It's particularly interesting to see Anthropic's dramatic rise, doubling their market share in just one year. A major reason for this is that Anthropic has been able to offer superior performance for coding tasks.

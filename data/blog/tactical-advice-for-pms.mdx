# 11 Tactical Things that Make an Effective PM

Sharing a list of 11 things that I have relied on over the years to play my part as a PM. Let me know what more I can add to this.

1. All else being equal, lean towards the decision that accelerates launch.

2. Invest in relationships with engineering. Always helpful. One easy way to do this is to have effective 1:1s and help during performance reviews.

3. How to help with performance review? Must do - make the product metrics and achievement easily available for use by your team to represent the impact of work. Optional - volunteer to write feedback.

4. PMs are in the business of influencing. Do whatever it takes to influence in the culture you operateâ€”write docs, record talks, get customer quotes, invite team/leadership to customer meetings, etc.

5. There is never 100% data to make a decision. But also don't just throw in the dark. Gather evidence you can, make an educated guess, and be transparent about it.

6. More engineers, more features always seem like a solution. But they never quite are. Learn to live happily, prioritize ruthlessly, and innovate continuously with the resources you have.

7. You don't control most of the things around launch. But you can influence almost 100% of the things around launch. Don't let things just slip away.

8. Build what will be useful. Sell what's already working. Don't wait for the current feature in the pipeline to launch and then sell afterwards.

9. Listen first. Take time to think (at least 10 seconds). Then only respond. PM's words have more power than given credit for. Use wisely.

10. Manage time wisely. Pick any framework, just stick with it. Nothing is perfect. Simpler is better. It all works only and only when you follow through and through. Here is [mine](https://medium.com/p/ffa54eefffd5).

11. Remember the ABC of PMing. Always Be Cipping!

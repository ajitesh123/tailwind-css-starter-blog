summary: 'My journey to accepting a Product Manager role at Google and reflections on the interview process.'

I have an update to share. A few weeks back, I accepted an offer from Google for the Product Manager role. I would be joining August next year.

I'm incredibly grateful to get this platform to create, design, build, and code for everyone. The word "everyone" is really important to me. I want to work towards solving problems for everyone in the world, irrespective of status or geography.

I enjoyed my interview experience with Google, and I intend to share what helped me with my preparation. The best part of the interview were interviewers â€“ passionate about technology and genuinely nice. One of the interviewers even volunteered to team up for my dream project of building the [Harry Potter wand in real life](https://www.thepmcareer.com/about).

I look forward to working with some of the best PMs in the tech industry on problems of global scale, and I intend to keep writing and sharing what I learn.

PS: I penned a heartfelt blog ([That was close](https://www.thepmcareer.com/blog/failed-google-interview)) after I failed at Google interview during internship recruitment 6 months back.

Things to learn from legends of product world - a running collection

The best builders in the world don't happen to be product managers. But that doesn't mean we (product managers) can't learn from these legends. It certainly will be a better use of time than reading most business books and definitely books on product management.

That led me to collect nuggets of wisdom from the best builders in the world in this blog. This blog of course will start small with handful of nuggets, but I expect to add more with time as I come across new ones and you (the readers) point to me ðŸ™‚

I will also put comments from my side to provide context and explain to myself, which may or may not be useful to you, so worth noticing or ignoring accordingly.

      Ps: It may come across in my blog that I don't like being PM, but I do love it. But I don't
      like the extra glamor and credit this role gets at times. In my opinion, the closest analogies
      for us, Product Managers, are somewhere between neutrinos and dark matter: always around,
      allegedly doing something vital, but hard to pin down with any certainty.

# 1: Sam Altman: Always keep momentum

Sam Altman discussed this in the context of startups. However, having done startup and built products in Big Tech, I feel it applies well to later as well. Momentum can solve many problems within a team, such as obtaining headcounts and keeping people motivated.

One effective way to achieve this is to "always be (c)shipping," which I refer to as "ABC" for product management. This is especially critical in the B2B world, where waiting two years to ship can be disastrous for many reasons, including team promotions, attracting sales attention, generating interest, and more.

Recently, I came across "heartbeat framework" on this from Resend Cofounder - Zeno Rocha.

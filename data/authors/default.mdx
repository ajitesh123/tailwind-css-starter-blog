I am Ajitesh. I am an engineer, product lover, MBA graduate, and a fitness enthusiast in that order.

I love writing, and I am an active contributor on Quora and part of many publications on Medium.

I am a IIT Delhi graduate. IIT Delhi played a significant role in shaping my worldview and build my foundation in technology and software development.

I was part of Founding team of Fitso, a health-tech startup. At Fitso, I worked in a cross-functional team leveraging deep user research and product analytics to build a highly engaging app, which was awarded “Best App of the App Store” by Apple and “Editor’s Choice Award” by Google.

A typical for MBAs, during my MBA at the Kellogg School of Management, I seized the opportunity to dive deeper into engineering courses and side projects, particularly solifying my interst in Python, which I had on-off relatonship for multple years.

Last 6 months, I have wore every hat possible to build Archie AI right from applied LLM resarch to writing first verison of backend to DevOps to poking frontend.

When not working, I am an avid cyclist and runners, and I enjoy reading non-fiction a lot.

I am Ajitesh. I am an engineer, product lover, MBA graduate, and a fitness enthusiast in that order.

I am a big Harry Potter fan, and someday I want to replicate the wand and apparition process in real life. Besides making stupid jokes, I have mostly worked at the confluence of technology and business throughout my career.

I did engineering from IIT Delhi, where I never realized a bunch of programming courses will become so vital in the future. IIT played a significant role in shaping my worldview and build my foundation in technology and software development.

I was part of Founding team of Fitso, a health-tech startup. At Fitso, I worked in a cross-functional team leveraging deep user research and product analytics to build a highly engaging app, which was awarded “Best App of the App Store” by Apple and “Editor’s Choice Award” by Google.

Atypical for MBAs, during my MBA at the Kellogg School of Management, I seized the opportunity to dive deeper into engineering courses and side projects, particularly solifying my interst in Python, which I had on-off relatonship for multple years.

Last 6 months, I have wore every hat possible to build Archie AI right from applied LLM resarch to writing first verison of backend to DevOps to poking frontend.

When not working, I am an avid cyclist and runners, and I enjoy reading non-fiction a lot.

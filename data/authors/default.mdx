I am Ajitesh, the guy behind Xupler. I am an engineer, an MBA candidate at Kellogg School of Management, product growth professional, a finance lover, and a fitness enthusiast.

I love writing, and I am an active contributor on Quora and part of many publications on Medium.

I am Chemical Engineering graduate of IIT Delhi, 2013. At IIT, I was involved in Entrepreneurship Club and Board of Hostel Management.

After graduation, I worked for 2 years in KPMG in strategy consulting, advising businesses. I was interested in solving a large-scale consumer problem using technology. That’s why I joined Fitso, which is a health-tech startup. At Fitso, I worked in a cross-functional team leveraging deep user research and product analytics to build a highly engaging app, which was awarded “Best App of the App Store” by Apple and “Editor’s Choice Award” by Google.

For the next two years (2018-20), I will be at Kellogg Business School learning marketing, growth, and product management from world’s best in this field.

I am an avid cyclist and runners, and I enjoy reading non-fiction a lot.
